- [Creating a computer science canon](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=611892.612002)

I was looking at the references to [yesterday's paper](./2019-06-12-rigorous-benchmarking.html)
when I came across [A Canon](http://evaluate.inf.usi.ch/canon) referring to this paper.

The paper talks about how they're teaching a course focused on reading "classic"
papers which have left a lasting inpact on Computer Science. Alluding to liberal
arts curriculum which contain courses focused on reading classic literary works,
the author presents the design and readings selected for the course and offers
comments on how various papers have been received by students.

A quick search shows a number of courses based on "classic" readings:

- [University of Colorado (original)](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~duck/canon2000/readinglist.html)
- [Stanford University](http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs208-11-spring/)
- [UC Berkeley](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~christos/classics/cs298.html)
- [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/~mrm/EECS583Spring2009syllabus.pdf)

### thoughts

I kind of expected Turing and Boole, but I didn't expect Ada or Babbage to be on
the list; I guess the readings really are meant to be "classics" without much
emphasis on practicality.

The purpose of my summarizing/commenting on various research papers is to
motivate surveying potentially relevant work. So the papers listed here are not
the kind that I'm interested in reading right now, but I'll probably revisit
this paper sometime in the future.
